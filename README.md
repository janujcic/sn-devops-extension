# SN DevOps Extension

The main goal of this extension is to simplify the work needed to review the ServiceNow commits and pull requests in Azure DevOps. 

Azure DevOps enables easy reviewing of code changes. Unfortunately, scripts form only a smart part of the files usually committed from ServiceNow. A large part of files are configuration files in XML format. To correctly review them it is useful to see the original file in the ServiceNow platform. This is one of the key things this extension enables.
